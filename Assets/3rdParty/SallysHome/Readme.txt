Thank you for purchasing Sally's Home!
======================================

Please wait for Unity to bake the scene, and make sure to use linear color space for the asset! 

To change the exterior wall color, modify albedo of Siding.mat!

Lightswitch example is included in the demo scene for the porch lights. Set the two point lights nested to them to Realtime, and when looking at them, press E to turn
them off/on. 

Demo scene: To open windows, press 'E' when looking at them, to break them out, press 'G'.

Mobile developers
=================
 - Switch platform to mobile (iOS and Android supported)
 - Remove grading post effect from camera along with HDR
 - set all lights to 'baked', do not leave realtime shadow casters
 - Use baked GI only (disable Precomputed realtime GI)
 - Reduce reflection probes' resolution and disable HDR on them
 - Click on Build to bake the entire scene
 - Bake Occlusion data as well with smallest occluder size: 2 


Any feedback/suggestion/idea is greatly appreciated and always welcome at Gabromedia@gmail.com!

Please rate the asset if you like it! 


Happy game development!
